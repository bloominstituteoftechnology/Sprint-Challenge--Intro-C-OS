# Sprint-Challenge: Intro to C and Operating Systems

Complete both.

## Challenge 1

Describe what would be necessary to write software if no operating
system was in place.

(Recommend making this a blog entry that you store at the location of
your choice. Barring, that, enter markdown in `challenge1.md`.)

## Challenge 2

Write a linked list in C with `int` payloads in each node. Write a
function to allocate a new node. Write another function to add that node
to the end of the list.

Bonus: search for a node, delete a node.
