# Sprint-Challenge: Intro to C and Operating Systems

Complete both challenges, below.

_The Challenge 2 code needs a Unix-like environment to work! That includes
Linux, macos, Cygwin, WSL, BSD, etc._

If you want to test if your environment is set up for it, compile and run the
[testdir.c](examples/testdir.c) program in the `examples/` directory. (You can
type `make` in the `examples/` directory.) It should print `Testing: PASS`.

## Challenge 1

Name at least three things that an operating system is responsible for handling?

- Managing the hardware resources of the computer such as the CPU, RAM, Graphics Cards, keyboards, all that. 
- It is responsible for being the part that users interface with. 
- Run and manipulate software applications.


## Challenge 2

Write a program in C, `lsls.c`, that prints out a directory listing for the
directory the user specifies on the command line. If the user does not specify a
directory, print out the contents of the current directory, which is called `.`.

### Example runs:

```
$ ./lsls
.
..
lsls.c
lsls

$ ./lsls /home/exampleuser
.
..
.config
.vim
.yarnrc
.bashrc
foo.c
.vscode
Downloads
.gitconfig
.bash_history
.viminfo
src
```

**Hint**: Start by just printing out the contents of the current directory `.`,
and then add the command line parsing later after you have it working.

### General approach

_You are expected to use Google to find examples of how to use these functions.
Also see [Details](#details), below._

1. Call `opendir()`.
2. Then repeatedly call `readdir()`--printing the filenames as you go--until it
   lets you know there are no more directory entries by returning `NULL`.
3. Then call `closedir()`.

You don't have to write the three functions, above. They're _system calls_ built
into the OS.

### Details

You will be using functionality included in `<dirent.h>`. This header file holds
the declarations for `DIR`, `struct dirent`, `opendir()`, `readdir()`, and
`closedir()`, below.

* `DIR *opendir(char *path)`: This function opens the directory named in `path`
  (e.g. `.`) and returns a pointer to a variable of type `DIR` that will be used
  later. If there is an error, `opendir()` returns `NULL`.
  
  _You should check for errors. If there is one, print an error message and exit
  (using the `exit()` function)._

* `struct dirent *readdir(DIR *d)`: Reads the next directory entry from the
  `DIR*` returned by `opendir()`. Returns the result as a pointer to a `struct
  dirent` (see below). Returns `NULL` if there are no more directory entires.

* `closedir(DIR *d)`: Close a directory (opened previously with `opendir()`)
  when you're done with it.

The `struct dirent *` returned by `readdir()` has the following fields in it:

```c
struct dirent {
  ino_t  d_ino       // file serial number
  char   d_name[]    // file name, a string
};
```

(You don't need to declare this `struct dirent` type. It's already included in
`<dirent.h>`.)

For output, you should print the field `d_name` from your `struct dirent *`
variable, e.g.

```c
struct dirent *ent;

// ... some of your code ...

ent = readdir(d);

printf("%s\n", ent->d_name);
```

To parse the command line, you'll have to look at `argc` and `argv` specified in
your `int main(int argc, char **argv)` function. Example code to print all
command line arguments can be found in [commandline.c](examples/commandline.c).
Modify that example to look at the command line parameters, if any, and pass
those to `opendir()`.

### Stretch Goal: Print file size in bytes

Modify the program to print out the file size in bytes as well as the name.

Example output (suggestion: use `%10lld` to print the size in a field of width
10):

```
$ ./lsls
    224  .
    992  ..
   1722  lsls.c
   8952  lsls
```

You'll need to use the `stat()` call in `<sys/stat.h>`.

* `int stat(char *fullpath, struct stat *buf)`: For a given full path to a file
  (i.e. the path passed to `opendir()` following by a `/` followed by the name
  of the file in `d_name`), fill the fields of a `struct stat` that you've
  pointed to. Returns `-1` on error.

  ```c
  // Example stat() usage

  struct stat buf;

  stat("./lsls.c", &buf);

  printf("file size is %lld\n", buf.st_size);
  ```

### Stretch Goal: Mark Directories

Instead of a size in bytes for a directory (which is marginally useful), replace
the number with the string `<DIR>`.

Example output:

```
$ ./lsls
     <DIR>  .
     <DIR>  ..
      1717  lsls.c
      8952  lsls
```

The `st_mode` field in the `struct stat` buffer holds information about the file
permissions and type of file.

If you bitwise-AND the value with `S_IFDIR` and get a non-zero result, the file
is a directory.

(If you bitwise-AND the value with `S_IFREG` and get a non-zero result, the file
is a regular file, as opposed to a device node, symbolic link, hard link,
directory, named pipe, etc.)
